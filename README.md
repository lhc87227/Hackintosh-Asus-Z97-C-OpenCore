# Hackintosh-Asus-Z97-C-OpenCore
Monterey 12.4
OpenCore 0.8.1 on Asus Z97-C with i7-4790 and AMD Radeon RX 580
This PC runs latest Catalina using this EFI smoothly.
Everything works - DRM, Handsoff, AirDrop, iMessages, FaceTime, SideCar and USB ports are mapped.
Notes
If you have the same motherboard, all you need to do is to use ProperTree and add your own SMBIOS (I use iMac17,1 for minimum SideCar support) in Config.plist. You might need to remap the USB ports as we might have different case for the front USB ports.
